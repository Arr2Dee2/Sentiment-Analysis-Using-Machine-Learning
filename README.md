## üìå Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on text data. Sentiment analysis can help businesses, researchers, and developers understand customer opinions, detect emotions, and make data-driven decisions.

We use machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## üß† Machine Learning and NLP Pipeline

The overall process includes:

- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Tokenization and vectorization
- Feature extraction using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF
- Model training using machine learning classifiers
- Performance evaluation

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We start by examining the input data and exploring key features for model building.

Next, we observe the distribution of sentiments across the dataset:

Wordclouds are generated to visualize frequently occurring words:

- Positive Sentiment:

- Negative Sentiment:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Training and Evaluation

After training, the model performance is evaluated based on loss and accuracy.
